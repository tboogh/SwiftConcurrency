    # Error handling
     Tasks in Swift Concurrency handle errors by using the try/catch pattern. This is a step away from the Result<Success, Error> pattern that is used in many closures. To indicate that a method can throws an error the `throws` keyword is added after the `async` keyword:
     */

    func aAsyncThrowingFunction() async throws {
        // Lets do some work, or throw an error ðŸ˜±!
        throw NSError(domain: "ðŸ˜±", code: 666)

        try await aAsyncThrowingFunction()

     The syntax is similar for an async property:
     */

            }
        }
    }
